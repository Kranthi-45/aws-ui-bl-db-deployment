Creating RDS 
================

Existing RDS link:
-----
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#database:id=moviedb;is-cluster=false

-> Search for RDS in aws service & open in newtab
-> create Database
    -Engine option = mysql
    -version       = MySQL8.0.20
    -Templates     = Freetire
    -settings
       give db name = movie
       Master username, pwd & confirm pwd  = root/rootpassword 
    -connectivity
        public access = yes
    -Additional config
       3306 port mysql default port

   Additional Configuration (outside)
     - give schema name -  movie

-> Finally click on 
    create Database

   
-> It will take some time to create
   Now we created the RDS instance & need to provide RDS endpoint in our springboot
   Application configurations instead localhost need to point aws db/rds instance url

   application.properties
	spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/movies5
	spring.datasource.username=root
	spring.datasource.password=Ks_961796

-> When status is Available then db is created successfully.
                         
                           
-> For RDS/DB endpoint of aws
   wait untill db is created then go to
    Databases -> dbinstance u will see (click on Database Identifier) -> Database Identifier
              -> Connectivity & security (copy the endpoint url) 


-> copy above RDS endpoint url  ,created username & password in application.properties file as below

#aws RDS mysql configs
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://moviedb.cpyvqeigqkwn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/moviedb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=rootpassword

-> Step (optional)
   Click on DB indentifier ->  connectivity & security  -> VPC security groups(click on it)
   -> Enable port number 3306 -> select securitygroupid -> Inbound rules (here enable protocols) -> Edit inbound rules -> Add rule -

	Custom TCP	TCP3306		Anywhere-IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 
   	
   -db is running on default security groups, that will stops our request If we dont enable protocal , the db/protocal running on 3306.


-> By adding protocol/inbound rule, we are telling AWS security groups to allow the request to 3306 port/protocal.

-> Once Database is created, how to verify are we able to connect to cloud db or not we can use Mysql Workbench

-> Open Mysql Workbench
	- crete new connection -> + symbol
		connection name: AWS-RDS-MYSQL
		Host Name: moviedb.cpyvqeigqkwn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com (endpoint name in aws rds)
		username:root
		password:rootpassword

        - click on Test connection or ok  (Mysql connection is successfull it is done).
	- open AWS-RDS-MYSQL connection , execute below queries to check
	
		show databases;
		use moviedb;
		show tables;

-------------------

-> Now we need to deploy the backend code in Elastic Beanstalk
   Either u can directly deploy into Elastic Beanstalk or
    create EC2 instance for backend code & then deploy it

-> If we are using Elastic Beanstalk need to change port to 5000 as below
  
    application.properties
      
     server.port=5000  
   
-> Create jar of backend application
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    mvn clean package -DskipTests

-> Go to AWS management console/ search bar
  
   -search for Elastic Beanstalk
   -Open in new tab  
   -becoz we need to deploy our jar to elatic beanstalk
   -internally it will store artifacts in S3 bucket & creates EC2 instance with that

Elastic Beanstalk:
-----------
  
-> Create Environment
    web server environment -> select -> Fill details

    Application Information
	Application name= movie-bl-service

    Environment Information  - created automatically
        Domain = moviebl  (check availablity)
    
    Platform
        platform name = Java
        platform branch = select java 8 or select available one
    
   -click on configure more options -> db settings
         or
     Next - Next -> untill u see Database settings
      
     Database
          Enable it  & provide username & password of created mysql RDS instance.
   
   -Next -> next -> submit or create environment

-> It will take some time to complete to create elastic beanstack environment
-> Internally it will create RDS instance with the given details of db in elatic bean stalk & configure with the bean stalk, so we can host or application into elastic bean stalk

-> Then it will Internally create EC2 instance also
