Domain Name using Route 53
==========================

-> It's a powerfull DNS service of a AWS, In this we will learn how to buy a domain from 3rd party domain provider & connect to Route 53
-> So you can start Routing traffic to th services in AWS using Route 53.

Custom Domain Name:
-------------

-> Login AWS
-> Search or Head over to Route 53
-> You will see Hosted Zones or Create one new Hosted zone (nothing but domain)
-> Create New Hosted zone
	-Each Hostedzone will costs 50 cents per a month for free tier also.
	-Domain name:  we can purchase domainnames via AWS but it is more expensive & limited

->NameCheap (3rd party to buy domainname)

        -Go to 3rd party to buy domain name ex: namecheap
		- link: https://namecheap.com
		- search with name u want to create, it will show results with domain & costs. then choose chepeast one
			ex:  kranthi.xyz   ()
		- Add to cart & checkkout,  sighnup & login to namecheap.com to proceed further
		- confirm order
		- Need to manage the domainname now,  click on manage button
		- Under NAMESERVERS: select Custom DNS
	                                <aws_hosted_zones_name>
					------------------- (add point this domain names to aws, if anyone goes to our domainname & then end, it will determine by aws)

                - Before that neeed to provide aws hostedzone  & so please create hostedzone in aws.

-> Create New Hosted zone

	- Domain name:  kranthi.xyz (which recently purchased in namecheap)
	  Type:		publiz hosted zone (becoz I need people need to access via public internet)
	
	- Click Create Hosted Zone  (will take only few seconds)

-> Go to HostedZones -> Records -> First record is recently created on

	- For created hostedzone kranthi.xyz will have last column with list of Named Servers at AWS (need to import these name servers in namecheap toget this working)

		Value/Route traffic to       (copy below namedservers to namecheap domains)

		ns-736.awsdns-28.net.
		ns-1970.awsdns-54.co.uk.
		ns-78.awsdns-09.com.
		ns-1201.awsdns-22.org. 

->HeadBack to NameCheap:
		- purchased domain name recently  "kranthi.xyz"
		- Need to manage the domainname now, click on manage button.
		- Under NAMESERVERS: select Custom DNS
	                                <aws_hosted_zones_name>  //Add here all aws named servers
			ex:             ns-736.awsdns-28.net.
					ns-1970.awsdns-54.co.uk.
					ns-78.awsdns-09.com.
					ns-1201.awsdns-22.org.

                - click on green tick to save (right side)
		- once this is done saving, that connection is complete
	
-> summary:
	I have purchased domain name verycheap around dollar in namecheap & it is now connected to Router 53 hostedzone.

-> This change to propogate throw all Named servers around the world, it will take 24hrs (to use any of the Route 53 services).

-> Create Simple Record in Route54 that points to EC2 instance (we can test like this Untill our above DomainName's are up to use )

     => Copy EC2 instace running IPV4 address  (usually this is how we access our webservers throw EC2 instance )

	-> AWS login
	-> Go to EC2 instance
	-> I have one webserver running in EC2 instance so copy/take one ipv4 address
     
     => HeadBack to Route 53
	
	-> Create Hostedzone -> create record   (create basic record that points to EC2 Instance)
        -> Fill Details before that (switch to wizard view instead formview which is towards rightside)
        -> Simple routing
        -> Next & Define Simple record
	-> Record name
		-specify subdomain name 
                    ex: demo1           (probably I am going to use for bunch of different services in aws & will se)
		   so we can access as
			demo1.kranthi.xyz (<subdomain>.<domain_name>)
	-> Record Type
		- Choose:  A-Routes traffic to an IPV4 address and some AWS resources.
		- Choose endpoint:   S3 or APIgateway or CloudFront or IP address (for EC2Instance)  or load balancers
				    (ex: S3, means I want to setup domain name for S3bucket that is hosting website & similarly for cloudfront..etc)
		                   -These is how we define domain name for bunch of AWS services.
	        
		- Rite Now choosing IP Address for EC2Instance that is hosting one webserver rite now (so All I need is EC2instance public IPV4 address & copy that
			& paste here in blank area)

		- Copy & paste here IPV4 address of hosted webserver in EC2
	
	-> Click Define Simple record
	-> click Create Records  

-> All of these DNS things will take a little bit of time
	-> we have setup domainname wait a day
	-> we have setup record also wait 30mins to 1hr.

-> After waiting plese visit the domain name
