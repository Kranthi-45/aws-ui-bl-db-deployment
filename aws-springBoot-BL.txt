-> Now we need to deploy the backend code in Elastic Beanstalk
   Either u can directly deploy into Elastic Beanstalk or
    create EC2 instance for backend code & then deploy it

-> If we are using Elastic Beanstalk need to change port to 5000 as below
  
    application.properties
      
     server.port=5000  
   
-> Create jar of backend application
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    mvn clean package -DskipTests

-> Go to AWS management console/ search bar
  
   -search for Elastic Beanstalk
   -Open in new tab  
   -becoz we need to deploy our jar to elatic beanstalk
   -internally it will store artifacts in S3 bucket & creates EC2 instance with that

Elastic Beanstalk:
-----------
  
-> Create Environment
    web server environment -> select -> Fill details

    Application Information
	Application name= movie-bl-service

    Environment Information  - created automatically
        Domain = moviebl  (check availablity)
    
    Platform
        platform name = Java
        platform branch = select java 8 or select available one
    
   -click on configure more options -> db settings
         or
     Next - Next -> untill u see Database settings
      
     Database
          Enable it  & provide username & password of created mysql RDS instance.
   
   -Next -> next -> submit or create environment

-> It will take some time to complete to create elastic beanstack environment
-> Internally it will create RDS instance with the given details of db in elatic bean stalk & configure with the bean stalk, so we can host or application into elastic bean stalk

-> Then it will Internally create EC2 instance also
 
 
--------Elastic Beanstalk

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-east-1#/applications

-> create Application
-> Fill below details
	Application name: movie-bl-service
	Platform:	Java
	Application code: Upload your code 
			  version label name: movie-bl-service
			-> Local file -> Upload jar file
-> Next 
   go to step3  where Database configurations available
	
	Database ->
			-Enable
			-Fill db details, username & pass
			-Create snapshot

-> I will skip all the optional steps,  go to final Review step & submit

-> Then it will create Environment in the backend then our application will deploy there
    so then we can use our application.

   -so while using deployed app there are some issues regardin port we should aware
   -by default it/beans tag accepts to run in 5000 port
   -if our application runs in 5000 port, the request which comes on 80 will
     forwarded to 5000 & we can use our application (currently our bl app running 80 or 90       	port).
   -configure below in application.properties in springboot jar

	#Elastic Beanstalk port
	server.port=5000
